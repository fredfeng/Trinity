Defining a DSL
==============

Tyrell is a framework that helps people build program *synthesizers*.

A synthesizer, as the name suggests, generates *programs* as its output. Therefore the first question to ask when building a synthesizer is: what do these programs looks like?

Shape of a program
==================

The Tyrell framework recognizes programs in a simplistic form: a program is an expression that can either be an atom or a function application:

::

  program := expr
  expr    := atom
           | func (expr*)

Here ``func`` just represents a function identifier.

An atom is either a constant, or a reference to the program's input value:

::

  atom := const
        | "@param" INT

Here ``const`` represent a constant identifier, and `INT` is just an index of the corresponding input value.

For example, this is a valid program supported by Tyrell:

::

  mult(plus(@param0, 1), minus(@param1, 2))

Intuitively, this program tries to compute `f(x, y) = (x + 1) * (y - 2)`.


.. _sec-syntax-spec:

Syntax specification
====================

Different domains may need different collections of functions and constants. Different functions may have different arities. It is also rarely the case that function arguments can take arbitrary values: Sometimes we know that certain argument may only be chosen from a small set of constants, and sometimes we know that certain argument may only be of a specific type.

To help narrow down the space of valid programs, Tyrell uses *spec file* to refine a program's specification on a syntax level. Here is a simple example of such a spec file:

.. code-block:: none
  :linenos:

  enum IntConst {
    "0", "1", "2"
  }
  value IntValue;

  program BinaryArithFunc(IntValue, IntValue) -> IntValue;

  func const: IntValue -> IntConst;
  func plus: IntValue -> IntValue, IntValue;
  func minus: IntValue -> IntValue, IntValue;
  func mult: IntValue -> IntValue, IntValue;

Each spec file starts with type definitions (line 1 to 4). Tyrell supports two kinds of types:

- The ``enum`` type represent a type whose universe is a pre-defined set. In this example, arguments of the `IntConst` type may only be ``"0"``, ``"1"``, or ``"2"``. Note that elements in the set must be quoted.
- The ``value`` type represent a type whose universe cannot be pre-determined. This should be the case for the input/output of the program.

Next section in the spec file is the input/output definition (line 6). It starts with the keyword ``program``, followed by the name of the program, followed by the input types of the program, and finally the ``->`` symbol and the output type of the program. Note that the types that appear in this part of the spec file must all be ``value`` types.

In the end (line 8 to 11), we specify what functions may appear in the program, and what kind of arguments these functions take. Note that unlike the input/output definition, the return type of the function comes before all the argument types. In this example, we defined 4 functions: one unary function ``const`` that takes a ``IntConst`` and produces a ``IntValue``, and three binary functions ``plus``, ``minus``, and ``mult`` that take two ``IntValue`` and returns ``IntValue``.


Spec file parsing
=================

Tyrell comes with a pre-installed console script ``parse-tyrell-spec`` that can read the spec file and check its consistency. We can save our example as a file ``bin_arith.tyrell``, and feed it into the script:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ parse-tyrell-spec bin_arith.tyrell

If the spec file is correctly written, no error would be reported.

Alternatively, the spec parser can be directly accessed from a python script:

.. code-block:: python

  from tyrell.spec import parse_file
  spec = parse_file('bin_arith.tyrell')

The :func:`~tyrell.spec.do_parse.parse_file` function takes file path as a parameter, and it will try to parse the content in that file. If the spec file is stored in a in-memory string instead of an on-disk file, we use :func:`~tyrell.spec.do_parse.parse` function instead:

.. code-block:: python

  from tyrell.spec import parse
  spec = parse(r'''
      enum IntConst {
        "0", "1", "2"
      }
      ...
  ''')


Manual program construction
===========================

With the parsed ``spec``, one thing we can do is to quickly construct a program that conforms to this spec. This is available through :class:`~tyrell.dsl.builder.Builder` APIs.

.. code-block:: python

  from tyrell.spec import parse_file
  from tyrell.dsl import Builder
  spec = parse_file('bin_arith.tyrell')
  builder = Builder(spec)

  # Below we construct the program f(x, y) = (x + 1) * (y - 2)
  param_0 = builder.make_param(0)  # Use make_param to create input reference
  param_1 = builder.make_param(1)
  enum_1 = builder.make_enum('IntConst', '1')  # Use make_enum to create node of IntConst type
  enum_2 = builder.make_enum('IntConst', '2')
  const_1 = builder.make_apply('const', [enum_1])  # Use make_apply to create function application
  const_2 = builder.make_apply('const', [enum_2])  # Note that we need to wrap the enums into a 'const' node: otherwise the program will not type-check according to our spec
  plus_node = builder.make_apply('plus', [param_0, const_1])
  minus_node = builder.make_apply('minus', [param_1, const_2])
  prog = builder.make_apply('mult', [plus_node, minus_node])

  # Pretty-print the program
  print(prog)

The process can be simplified using :meth:`~tyrell.dsl.builder.Builder.from_sexp_string`:

.. code-block:: python

  # Program can be specified with S-expressions
  prog = builder.from_sexp_string(
      '''
      (mult
          (plus
              (@param 0)
              (const (IntConst "1"))
          )
          (minus
              (@param 1)
              (const (IntConst "2"))
          )
      )
      '''
  )
  print(prog)

  # Dump the program back into sexp form
  from sexpdata import dumps
  print(dumps(prog.to_sexp()))

The builder APIs returns objects of class :class:`~tyrell.dsl.node.Node`, which represent a node in the program's *abstract syntax tree*. Take a look at the doc if you are interested in what methods are defined on it. Also, check out the nice utilities like :func:`~tyrell.dsl.iterator.dfs`, :func:`~tyrell.dsl.iterator.bfs`, :class:`~tyrell.dsl.indexer.NodeIndexer`, and :class:`~tyrell.dsl.parent_finder.ParentFinder`.


Semantics specification
=======================

Now that we know what the programs look like, the next question is what do they mean. In Tyrell, we attach semantic actions to the syntax through an *interpreter*.

The base class for a Tyrell interpreter is :class:`~tyrell.interpreter.interpreter.Interpreter`. To implement your own interpreter, inherit from :class:`~tyrell.interpreter.interpreter.Interpreter` and override its :meth:`~tyrell.interpreter.interpreter.Interpreter.eval` method, which takes a program and a list of input arguments, interprets the program, and returns the output.

For example, a simple interpreter for the small language we defined in the previous section may look like this:

.. code-block:: python

  from tyrell.interpreter import Interpreter

  # Define the interpreter subclass
  class BinaryArithFuncInterpreter(Interpreter):
      def eval(self, node, inputs):
          return 0

  # Create the interpreter object and run it
  interp = BinaryArithFuncInterpreter()
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(@param 0)'), [3, 4]))    # Prints 0
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(const (IntConst 1))'), [3, 4]))  # Prints 0
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(plus (@param 1) (const (IntConst 2)))'), [3, 4]))  # Prints 0

Well, this is not a super interesting interpreter, as it interprets any program to ``0``. To make it more interesting, we could have examined what the structure of ``node`` is, and take different actions according to whether it's a parameter, an enum, or a function application (in which case you may need to recurse down and interpret its arguments).

It turns out that in most situations we want to recursively interpret the programs in a *post order* tree traversal. In other words, for function applications we want to interpret the values of each the argument before the application itself can be interpreted. If that's the case, we can save a lot of keystrokes for those boilerplate ``node`` inspection code by inheriting from :class:`~tyrell.interpreter.post_order.PostOrderInterpreter`. If we take this option, all we need to do is to define one ``eval`` method for each enum and each function. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

  from tyrell.interpreter import PostOrderInterpreter

  # Define the interpreter subclass by specifying the meaning of each enum and each function
  class BinaryArithFuncInterpreter(PostOrderInterpreter):
      # First, interpret the enums by defining method 'eval_XXX' for each enum type named XXX.

      def eval_IntConst(self, v):
          # The argument v is always a string that was defined in our enum definition.
          # In this case, it can be '0', '1', or '2'.
          # Here we just turn it into an integer and return the result.
          return int(v)

      # Next, interpret the functions by defining method 'eval_YYY' for each function named YYY

      def eval_const(self, node, args):
          # The node argument is the corresponding AST node for the "const" application. In this example we don't need to look at it.
          # The args argument is a list of values for the arguments of this "const" application.
          # Since we have defined "const" as a unary function whose argument type is "IntConst", here the length of args will always be 1.
          # And args[0] will always be an integer, as in eval_IntConst we have interpreted all IntConsts as integers.
          return args[0]

      def eval_plus(self, node, args):
          return args[0] + args[1]

      def eval_minus(self, node, args):
          return args[0] - args[1]

      def eval_mult(self, node, args):
          return args[0] * args[1]

  # Create the interpreter object and run it
  interp = BinaryArithFuncInterpreter()
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(@param 0)'), [3, 4]))    # Prints 3
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(const (IntConst 1))'), [3, 4]))  # Prints 1
  print(interp.eval(builder.from_sexp_string('(plus (@param 1) (const (IntConst 2)))'), [3, 4]))  # Prints 6
